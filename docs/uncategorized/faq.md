# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

Listed below are some of the most commonly asked questions.

## General

#### Where is the server located?
> The server is hosted in Germany.

#### How reliable is the API?
> Our API currently maintains an uptime of at least 99.98% annually.

#### Is attribution required for using the API?
> No, attribution is not required, but it is appreciated.

## Images & GIFs

#### How safe are the images and GIFs?
> We prioritize fully safe-for-work content. Unlike many other anime APIs, you won’t find characters in sexually suggestive outfits (e.g., swimsuits, bikinis, underwear, transparent clothing, or overly revealing outfits).\
> Additionally, we exclude content such as panty shots (where underwear is intentionally visible), armpit-focused “bait,” and similar fetish-oriented content.\
> Every image and GIF is carefully selected to ensure safe, high-quality content rather than sheer quantity.

#### Can I use the images or GIFs commercially?
> No. Commercial use is prohibited as outlined in the [Terms and Conditions](/legal/tos).\
> The images are not owned by us and are shared purely for entertainment purposes, with proper credits to the original creators.

#### Am I required to include the artists’ credits?
> While you are not required to include the artists’ credits, we strongly recommend doing so, as the API already provides this information.

#### There is an incorrect or missing source listed for an image or GIF. Where should I report this?
> If you notice an incorrect or missing source in the API, please report it in our Discord server. Go to the `#api-support` channel and create a new post.

#### Can you add X to the API?
> Category suggestions should be submitted via our Discord server, where we have a dedicated channel for `#suggestions`.
>
> **Note:** Only SFW category suggestions are accepted. Suggestions involving content such as lick or kidnap do not align with our SFW guidelines and will be rejected.

#### When will new images, GIFs, or categories be released?
> There is no fixed release schedule or ETA. All content is added manually, and updates are made when they are ready and when the owners have the available personal time to work on them.

#### Can I contribute images or GIFs to the API?
> Absolutly. If you’d like to contribute, please join our Discord server and create a post in the `#api-support`.
> Contributors receive a special Contributor role in our Discord community.

## Debugging / Errors
