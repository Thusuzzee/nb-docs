# DMCA & Copyright Policy

Last updated: **14.02.2026**

This DMCA & Copyright Policy describes how **NEKOSBEST** (“we”, “us”, “our”) handles copyright infringement claims relating to content made available through the **nekos.best website** and the **NEKOSBEST API** (“Service”).

## 1. General Statement

NEKOSBEST respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Service to do the same.

The Service hosts and distributes third-party images and GIFs for informational and entertainment purposes. We do not claim ownership over such content. All rights remain with their respective owners.

## 2. Copyright Infringement Notices (DMCA)

If you believe that content available through the Service infringes your copyright, you may submit a written takedown notice in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).

All notices must be sent **by email only** to:

**contact@nekos.best**

## 3. Required Information for a Valid Notice

To be effective, a copyright infringement notice **must include all of the following**:

1. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed  
2. Identification of the infringing material, including:
   - Exact URLs, API endpoints, or other sufficient information to locate the material
3. Your name, organization (if applicable), email address, and contact information
4. A statement that you have a **good-faith belief** that the use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law
5. A statement that the information in the notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on their behalf
6. A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or authorized representative

Incomplete or invalid notices may be ignored.

## 4. Takedown Procedure

Upon receipt of a **valid** infringement notice:

- The identified content will be **removed entirely** from the Service
- The content will be added to an internal **blocklist** to prevent reappearance
- Removal applies to both the website and the API

## 5. Counter-Notification

If you believe that content was removed in error, you may submit a counter-notification by email to **contact@nekos.best**.

A valid counter-notice must include all information required under applicable copyright law, including a statement under penalty of perjury that the removal was a mistake or misidentification.

If a counter-notice is received:
- It may be forwarded to the original claimant
- We reserve the right to restore or permanently remove the content at our discretion
- Content may remain unavailable unless legally required otherwise

## 6. Repeat Infringement Policy

Content that has been subject to a valid takedown request will not be reintroduced.

If a specific source, contributor, or dataset repeatedly results in infringement claims, we reserve the right to permanently block that source from the Service.

## 7. Abuse of the Takedown Process

We reserve the right to **ignore** notices that are:
- Incomplete
- Clearly abusive
- Submitted in bad faith
- Repetitive without new information

Misuse of the takedown process may result in future notices being disregarded.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this DMCA & Copyright Policy from time to time.

Material changes will be announced via our **Discord community**.  
The date at the top reflects the current version.
